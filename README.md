# DXSpider Deployment

This is a deployment project for [DX Spider](http://wiki.dxcluster.org/index.php/Main_Page)
Amateur Radio DX Cluster software, independent of DX Spider development.

This project focuses on easy DX Spider deployment in virtualised/cloud
environments and as such its focus is primarily supporting telnet nodes running
on TCP networks.

This repo adds the connection to a mariadb container and a simple webinterface.
In addition the DXspider container has a ttyd based webconsole to login for sysop activities.



## Running in docker-compose

All the configuration is in the `.env` file. Edit it so match your parameters and setting and then
just run the following command to test the configuration:

```sh
docker compose config
```
This should show no errors. Don't miss to set safe passwords for the sysop.

To download, build and run the containers:

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```


Note: you might want to change some extra settings inside the `.env` or
`docker-compose.yml` file itself.

The `/dxspider/motd` (Message of the day) file and `/dxspider/connect` files need to be manually updated.
Finding partner nodes works via die DXCluster forum or contact other sysops that run DXSpider nodes.

You can now telnet to your cluster node and use it list like any other telnet
node:

```txt
$ telnet localhost 7300
Trying ::1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
login: MY1CALL
MY1CALL
Hello Joe Bloggs, this is MY1CALL-2 in London, England
running DXSpider V1.55 build 0.166
Cluster: 1 nodes, 1 local / 1 total users  Max users 1  Uptime 0 00:08
MY1CALL de MY1CALL-2  4-Oct-2018 0918Z dxspider >
```

If you want to allow external connections to your node, you will need to allow
this traffic on your firewall.

To show logs from all containers:

```show logs
docker compose logs
```

To put down the server, run:

```sh
docker compose down
```

### Sysop Shell

In order to get a sysop shell in your running Docker container:

```sh
docker compose exec dxspider-deployment-cluster-1 sh
```

You can use the ttyd Webconsole on `localhost:8080` to directy access the cluster sysop console.
Login with sysop username and password.
